# Open Runway

**An open-source, agentic video editor for the AI era.**

Open Runway is a community-driven project to build a new kind of video editor. It integrates the best features of powerful tools like Runway, Descript, CapCut, InVideo, Kdenlive, and Blender into a single, cohesive platform. It's designed from the ground up for modern, AI-powered workflows, allowing creators to edit at the speed of thought.

## ✨ Vision

We believe the future of video editing is collaborative, intelligent, and open. Traditional tools are powerful but often have steep learning curves and lack the AI capabilities that are transforming content creation. Open Runway aims to bridge that gap by providing:

*   **An Agentic Workflow:** Use natural language to perform complex edits, generate content, and automate tedious tasks.
*   **A Unified Toolset:** Stop jumping between different applications. From transcript-based editing to advanced 3D effects, everything is in one place.
*   **Open & Extensible:** Built by the community, for the community. Anyone can contribute, add new features, and shape the future of the project.

## 🚀 Core Features (Planned)

*   **Agentic Editing:** Simply tell the AI what you want to do.
    *   *"Remove all the pauses and 'ums' from my recording."*
    *   *"Find a b-roll of a sunset and add it here."*
    *   *"Generate subtitles for the entire video."*
*   **Transcript-Based Editing:** Edit your video by editing the text, just like in Descript.
*   **AI Magic Tools:** A suite of AI-powered features for video generation, style transfer, object removal, and more, inspired by Runway.
*   **Powerful Timeline:** A robust, traditional timeline editor for fine-grained control, similar to Kdenlive and Blender's VSE.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** An intuitive, clean interface that's easy for beginners to pick up, taking cues from CapCut and InVideo.
*   **3D Integration:** Seamlessly import and work with 3D assets and scenes, leveraging the power of Blender.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Our high-level roadmap is as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Architecture:** Develop the foundational backend for video processing and establish the plugin architecture for AI agents.
2.  **Phase 2: Transcript & Timeline Integration:** Build the transcript-based editing interface and a functional timeline view.
3.  **Phase 3: Agent Development:** Create the first set of core AI agents for common editing tasks.
4.  **Phase 4: Community & Extensibility:** Refine the API and documentation to make it easy for the community to build and share their own agents and plugins.
